# PlayersConnectionChat
This is a 'fully functional replacement for kchat' that we wrote back in 1996. It is a DOS chat application that uses the IPX API and replaces the command line chat program in Kali. There isn't really anything interesting here, other to look at code we wrote 22+ years ago.

PC 0.80 - Players Connection

This is currently a fully functional replacement for kchat.

Please let us know if you have any problems or suggestions.
